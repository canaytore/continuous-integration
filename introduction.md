# CI/CD Tools

Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment are fundamental concepts in modern software development. More commonly known as CI/CD, technologists of all kinds use these automated approaches to produce applications efficiently and reliably. The process is often described as a pipeline, representing the flow of code and artifacts as they move through the different steps required to build, test, and deploy a complete application. Because this process is so important, there are dozens and dozens of CI/CD tools available, and often finding the right tool can be difficult.

In this repo, we will see how an experimental pipeline gets implemented in several different CI/CD applications.
